2/16
1) Addition of 'female' heads, however there are no female bodies yet -- I am a horrible artist and I couldn't create something that was acceptable to me.  I hope that for now the heads are good enough.  Sadly this requires a new client -- a new download.

3) Change to position of vita bar and text.
4) Tilda bug fixed.  Tildas are used for the font data at the end of text (i.e. "Wow~255~255~255~0~0~"), so the game now replaces tildas with dashes, sorry.
